# Proposals for WG21, the C++ standards committee

This repository contains my proposals for WG21.
Only papers starting with a `P` are officially published and can also be found in the [C++ paper mailings](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/).
The papers are written using [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed).
You can render them into HTML using [this website](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/) or by running:

```bash
curl https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ -F file=@<paper>.bs -F force=1 > paper.html
```
